#Image to CSS Tool on Node.js

img2css converts any image file to pixel perfect pure CSS image.

**Rendering modes:**
- box-shadow
- div

This is node.js version of the [img2css](https://github.com/roman01la/img2css) tool. Also it uses WebSockets ([socket.io](http://socket.io/) module) for real-time data transfering. Server-side image processing is much better in terms of performance.
